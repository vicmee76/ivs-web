Although we aim to keep the Platform available seven days a week, with exceptions for scheduled maintenance (usually on weekends or as necessary in emergency situations), you understand that we cannot guarantee continuous access. Any inability to access the Platform due to routine maintenance will not be considered a breach by IVS Socials, nor will it give rise to a cause of action against us.
